# Inventory Management Tracker

This project is an **Inventory Management Tracker** designed to streamline inventory operations. The application leverages modern web development technologies such as **Next.js**, **Firebase**, and **Material UI** to provide a responsive, real-time, and user-friendly interface for tracking and managing inventory.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: Integrated with Firebase Firestore to ensure real-time synchronization of inventory data across devices.
- **CRUD Operations**: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete inventory items efficiently.
- **Responsive Design**: Developed with Material UI to provide a visually cohesive and mobile-friendly user interface.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implemented SSR with Next.js to enhance performance and SEO.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Material UI
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore for database and authentication)
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Deployment**: Vercel (or applicable hosting service)

## How It Works
1. **Real-Time Inventory Management**:
   - Firestore integration enables instant updates when inventory data is modified.
2. **CRUD Functionality**:
   - Users can add, edit, delete, and view inventory items directly from the app.
3. **Responsive UI**:
   - Material UI ensures a clean and intuitive interface across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
